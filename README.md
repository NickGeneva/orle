# ORLE (OpenFOAM Reinforcement Learning Environment)

ORLE is a python module to make the use of OpenFOAM simulations accessable to reinforcement learning models.
Using simple job configurations, OpenFOAM enviroments can easily be requested on different hardware than the deep learning model.
ORLE will handle the modification of the simulation files, running the simulation, as well as getting the data into a more Python friendly form to learn from. 

Styling based on isort for imports and yapf.

### TODO List:
- Rerun simulation if output files not properly
